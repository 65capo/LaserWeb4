## Developers Note!
We use GitHub Projects https://github.com/openhardwarecoza/LaserWeb4/projects to manage this project!  Since we are now a multiperson team, please consider talking to the team often to avoid duplication, and other issues

## Community
Check the [LaserWeb/CNCWeb Google+ community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/115879488566665599508) for updates on the progress of this iteration of Laserweb.

Other than that, this is early, so check the [Issues tab](https://github.com/openhardwarecoza/LaserWeb4/issues) for "details".

## Looking for a functional version ?
Head over **[LaserWeb3](https://github.com/openhardwarecoza/LaserWeb3/)** instead if you'd like to use LaserWeb.
